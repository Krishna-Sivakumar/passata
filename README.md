# Passata ðŸ¥«

An accessible, sharable, pomodoro timer!

Also comes with other custom configurations to avoid overcooking your tomato sauce :P

### Dev Environment

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Build Instructions

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

### TODO
---
1. Add a form to customize the timer
2. Implement Server-Sent Events
3. Add link sharability
